### What is this repository for? ###

This repo is used to quickly transfer config files from one machine to another and to have a central place where all these configurations are stored.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Clone the repo.
* Check the file `files.txt` (ROUTEFILE). This is a map of the files in this repo to the supposed location on the machine. You can adapt it to the specific needs of each machine to only transfer certain files.
* Run `install.sh`. This will create backups of all files in the routefile and copy the repo versions to the locations specified. Done.
